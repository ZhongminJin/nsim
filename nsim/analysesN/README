These are analyses that apply to a MultipleSimulation instance.


Note: 
Once the `distob.DistArray` distributed array class is implemented, 
these can be removed. 
Instead there will be analyses acting on a distributed timeseries object
representing the output of all nodes of the MultipleSimulation.
